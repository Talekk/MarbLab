# MarbLab

This Arduino sketch allows for one joystick to control the 
attitude of the marble labyrinth via a pair of servos mounted
with perpendicular axes

The neutral position and maximum deviation from it can
be adjusted in the "Servo parameters" section

The "dead zone" of the joystick can be adjusted in the
"if" statements of the servoControl function
